### DATE: 22/04/2025                                                                           
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222060171
### AIM: 
To find the sequence of plan for Monkey Banana problem using PDDL Editor.
###  Algorithm:
Step 1:  Start the program <br> 
Step 2 : Create a domain for Monkey Banana Problem. <br> 
Step 3:  Create a domain by specifying predicates. <br> 
Step 4: Specify the actions GOTO, CLIMB, PUSH-BOX, GET-KNIFE, GRAB-BANANAS in Monkey Banana problem.<br>  
Step 5:   Define a problem for Monkey Banana problem.<br> 
Step 6:  Obtain the plan for given problem.<br> 
Step 7: Stop the program.<br> 

### Program:

      (:action CLIMB
      :parameters (?x)
